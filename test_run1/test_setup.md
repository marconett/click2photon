# Test setup

## Hardware

- Mainboard: B450 GAMING PRO CARBON AC
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D (16) @ 4.55 GHz
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER
- RAM: 2x8GB DDR4, 3200 MHz
- Monitor: MSI MAG 272QP QD-OLED X50 (500 Hz)
- Only one screen was connected to the system during the test

## Software

```sh
{
    echo "date: $(date -I)"
    echo "kernel: $(uname -r)"
    pacman -Q kwin
    pacman -Q xorg-server
    pacman -Q nvidia-utils
    pacman -Q proton-cachyos
    scxctl get
  } | tee versions.txt
```

Output:

```
date: 2026-07-12
kernel: 7.1.3-2-cachyos
kwin 6.7.2-1.1
xorg-server 21.1.24-1.1
nvidia-utils 610.43.03-1
proton-cachyos-native 1:11.0.20260602-3
no scx scheduler running
```

The test was done based on commit `7bc3f05` of click2photon.

## System Settings

- 500 Hz
- FLIP mode:
  - X11: OFF (via `nvidia-settings`)
  - Wayland: No way to turn this off
- If VRR was tested:
  - X11: Enabled via `nvidia-settings` (changing this requires a reboot)
  - Wayland: Enabled via KDE Settings Menu (no reboot needed)
- `showcompositing` was off on Wayland (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1u1z4qf/kde_kwin_patches_aiming_to_optimize_gaming/oqvlwdb/))

### dxvk

In all cases, the following is set in `dxvk.conf`:

```conf
d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = "c"
```

Depending on the test, an optimal `dxvk.conf` was setup:
- If VRR was off, `dxgi.maxFrameRate` was capped to 500 fps (the screens refresh rate)
- If VRR was on and `PROTON_DXVK_LOWLATENCY` was off, `dxgi.maxFrameRate` was capped to 497 fps (slightly below screen refresh rate)
- If VRR was on and `PROTON_DXVK_LOWLATENCY` was on, the following was used to utilize the low latency VRR frame pacing

```conf
# see https://github.com/netborg-afps/dxvk-low-latency
dxgi.maxFrameRate = 480
dxvk.lowLatencyOffset = 70
dxvk.framePace = "low-latency-vrr-500"
dxvk.lowLatencyAllowCpuFramesOverlap = False
```

## Game Settings

Test was done in Diabotical.

Settings:

- Everything Video Setting as low as possible
- 100% Render resolution
- Native resolution (2560×1440)
- Vsync off

## Methodology

- Close unnecessary Software
- Launch game
- Start a wipeout match, Map: wo_wellspring
- Move to a specific spot, put mouse on specific landmark
- Run the test case (100 clicks, runs for about 2 minutes)
- Once the test is done, start the next test case iteration

- Ingame conditions: No bots, no other players, no movement, no round restarts. It is basically just a static scene that will stay like this indefinitely.
- System conditions: During the test run, nothing else should be running and no significant other processes run on the system.

To start the test via click2photon:

```sh
uv run main.py
clicks 100
start
```

## Special test case: PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND

The setting "Enable wine-wayland" in Heroic Launcher corresponds to `PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND`. If not otherwise noted, all tests were done with `PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1` (native Wayland, no use of XWayland)

- `PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1` implies native Wayland
- `PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0` implies XWayland

## Setup notes

```sh
cd /home/hst/Games/Heroic/Diabotical/
cp diabotical.exe-TESTLATENCY diabotical.exe
```

In diabotical:
- `/bind mouse_left testlatency`
- Setup hud with accent box

```sh
cp diabotical.exe-ORIG diabotical.exe
```

Ingame: `/bind mouse_left attack`

## Ideas

Future test run ideas:

1. Testing different kernel schedulers:

```sh
sudo scxctl start --sched cosmos --mode gaming
sudo scxctl start --sched lavd --mode gaming
sudo scxctl stop
```

2. Compare against: https://themaister.net/blog/2026/07/02/my-side-quest-measuring-input-latency-with-vk_ext_present_timing/

3. Try different compositors (niri)
